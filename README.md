# Tilt To Live
Personal project for Darrien Lee. A rudimentary remake of a mobile game (of the same name) for PC.
Created using the unity game engine utilizing C#, sprites, and simple game logic. 

### Goals
Created as a personal project to learn and familiarize myself with C# scripting as well as to learn how game engine logic, gameplay programming, and game engine interfaces work.
As I am interested in developing interactable programs, video games, and other coding languages, this personal project was an interesting and fun journey learning new tools to add to my skill set.

### Tools Used
 - Unity Hub: v2.4.5 Personal License
 - Unity Version: v2021.1.15f1
 - Visual Studio Code: v1.60.2

### Running the Project
Step 1) Navigate to "/TiltToLive/Builds/Windows/x86_64/Version 1.1".

Step 2) Run "TiltToLive.exe" on a windows PC or compatible device.

Step 3) Enjoy!

### Notes
1. This is a very rudimentary remake of a mobile game that inspired me, many powerups, mechanics, and sprites are missing as a result.
2. As this was my first attempt at a Unity project, animations are not flushed out (only the projectile has any legitimate animations).
3. Many of the scripts follow tutorials from the Unity User Manual, various online forums, educational videos, and tutorial articles.
    - The project itself was implemented myself and only the logic remains from these various sources for my project to work coherently and properly.
4. For legal reasons, all sprites and assets are not mine nor do I claim ownership of them.
    - Sprites were found using google and from the Unity assets store, but edited and scaled myself.
